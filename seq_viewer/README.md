This application is meant to read the XML file(s) from a diretory
chosen by the user. The XML files are assumed  to be the format in which
General Electric (GE) scanners output sequence waveform information. If
there are multiple shots outputed by because the waveforms change each 
repetition time (TR), then the application will will play through each
shot.

It allows the user to stop, play forward and play backward the 
animation.
